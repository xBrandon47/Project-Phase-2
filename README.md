Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Pitch:

    The react project was intended for users who are interested in knowing the top motor vehicles in the hypercars category, and in the sports cars category. Also for the user to make their own top motor vehicle list.

Requirements:  

   1. Must make a single page application with only index.html file and creating a react app.
    2. The app should use at least 5 components to keep your code well organized.
    3. There Should be at least 3 client-side routes using React Router. Include a nav bar or UI element allowing users to navigate between routes. 
    4. Use an API or create a database. Then use a form to make your requests using the data.
    5. Add some styling: write your CSS from Scratch. 

App Interactions:

    The user will be able to view a home page with three different class categories, the title of the website, and a nav bar. The three different class categories and nav bar have a clickable link route to where you would like to go. The hypercars category will render a list of cars. Within that category page the user can like/dislike, add a comment/edit the comment, click on the image to reveal the front view of the car, and impound button to delete a car from the list. Each card will show information about the vehicle such as name, price, image, etc. Also the user has a search bar to look for the car they want to see. Same functionally applies to sports cars category. For the last category the user can input their own list, adding their photos, comments, name, while having the same functionally as the other categories page.
